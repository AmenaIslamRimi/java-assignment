## 1. Finding the 2nd Highest CGPA

**Objective:** Write a program to find the student with the 2nd highest CGPA from a list of CGPAs using a linear search algorithm.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Linear search

## 2. Sorting CGPA Array

**Objective:** Sort the array of CGPAs in descending order without using built-in sorting methods.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble sort)

## 3. Binary Search on CGPA Array

**Objective:** Implement a binary search to find if a given CGPA exists in the array. Assume the array is already sorted.

**Concepts Used:**
- Binary search
- Arrays
- User input
