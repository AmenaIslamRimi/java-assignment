## 1. Finding the 2nd Highest CGPA

**Objective:** Write a program to find the student with the 2nd highest CGPA from a list of CGPAs using a linear search algorithm.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Linear search

## 2. Sorting CGPA Array

**Objective:** Sort the array of CGPAs in descending order without using built-in sorting methods.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble sort)

## 3. Binary Search on CGPA Array

**Objective:** Implement a binary search to find if a given CGPA exists in the array. Assume the array is already sorted.

**Concepts Used:**
- Binary search
- Arrays
- User input

## 4. Random Number Array

**Objective:** Generate an array of 10 random integers, print all numbers, and find the maximum and minimum values.

**Concepts Used:**
- Random number generation
- Arrays
- Looping

## 5. Break Down Amount into Notes

**Objective:** Given an amount of money, break it down into the fewest number of currency notes possible.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Greedy algorithm

## 6. Pattern Printing

**Objective:** Write a program to print a specific pattern (first decrement 5-1, then increment 1-5).

**Concepts Used:**
- Nested loops
- String manipulation

## 7. Finding the 2nd Lowest Height

**Objective:** Write a program to find the 2nd lowest height among 10 babies without using a built-in sort method.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Linear search

## 8. String Analysis

**Objective:** Analyze a string to count the number of words, characters (excluding spaces), vowels, and consonants.

**Concepts Used:**
- String manipulation
- Looping

## 9. Character Frequency Counter

**Objective:** Count the frequency of each character in a string.

**Concepts Used:**
- Strings
- HashMaps (optional for advanced implementation)
- Looping

## 10. Finding Unique Numbers

**Objective:** Find and print the numbers in an array that are not duplicated.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Looping
- Conditional logic

## 11. Summing User Input

**Objective:** Continuously take integer input from the user and print the sum until the user inputs q. If a non-integer character is input, ask for input again.

**Concepts Used:**
- User input
- Loops
- Conditional statements

## 12. Cost Calculation with Discount

**Objective:** Calculate the total cost of a laptop and a mouse after a 15% discount is applied.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arithmetic operations
- String parsing
